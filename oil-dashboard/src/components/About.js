            <p>
                I am Mareye Zeleke Mekonen, a motivated Information Technology lecturer with 6 years of experience 
                across three Ethiopian universities. With a strong foundation in both theoretical and practical aspects, 
                I am interested in machine learning, image processing, information retrieval, natural language processing, 
                and nanotechnology. My contributions include designing a stemmer for Kafi-noonoo text retrieval and 
                leading the development of an Online Library System for Mettu University. I am dedicated to advancing 
                IT research and fostering academic and practical innovation.
